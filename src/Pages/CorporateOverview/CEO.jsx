                                Looking to the year passed by, Global Soda
                                Ash demand grew by 8.3% year-on -year
                                (5.3 mn MT), driven by an 18% increase
                                in China and a 4.5% rise in India. Demand
                                in the rest of the world declined by 2.3%.
                                However, capacity increased by 8.9% (6.5 mn
                                MT), leading to oversupplied markets with
                                an erosion of margins caused by a decline
                                in prices by over 25% from the previous
                                year, weighing heavily and impacting the
                                results of the company. Consequently,
                                our performance was substantially lower
                                than FY2024. Tata Chemicals saw Soda
                                Ash volume growth of 6% (+205 KT). Net
                                sales realisation across regions declined,
                                impacting contribution at consolidated level
                                (INR 5,969 crore CY Vs INR 6,867 crore PY).
                                Fixed cost was maintained at the last year’s
                                level (INR 4,016 crore CY Vs INR 4,020 crore
                                PY), resulting in a lower EBITDA (INR 1,953
                                crore CY Vs INR 2,847 crore PY).

                                Our operations were impacted by fluctuating
                                energy and feedstock costs, shipping costs and
                                logistical hurdles. We seamlessly met customer
                                needs through teamwork, efficient operations
                                and a resilient supply chain. Tata Chemicals
                                is focused on driving operational excellence
                                to improve its resilience aided by synergies
                                from our multi-geography presence. During
                                the year, UK soda ash Lostock plant ceased
                                operations due to lower product prices and
                                high gas costs resulting in sustained negative
                                margins. We will now pivot UK towards higher
