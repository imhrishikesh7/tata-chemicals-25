                                    Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) has been
                                    strongly incorporated into biscuits,
                                    cookies, Indian confectionery, drinks,

                                    bars and frozen dairy desserts. FOS
                                    L95 was recently used to enhance the
                                    taste, mouthfeel and functionality of a
                                    beloved, familiar treat category, cake.

                                    The client, a market leader in the cake
                                    segment, was working on a new cake formulation. The biggest challenge was
                                    to accept an ingredient, which would
                                    increase material cost. The venture
                                    began with evidence of concept via a
                                    myriad of to-be-determined iterated
                                    experiments and lab trials, with results
                                    being positive. The client’s R&D team
                                    was convinced that FOS L95 could
                                    enhance product quality without
                                    compromising its essential attributes. Our client’s product development
                                    team was pleased with the results
                                    and the trials strengthened the belief
                                    that FOS could definitely help take
                                    indulgence level in cakes one notch
                                    higher. We conducted months of
                                    testing, conducted conversations and
                                    assessments and eventually a decision
                                    was made to use FOS L95 cakes
                                    in their products. The change was
                                    officially implemented, setting a new
                                    industry benchmark.
